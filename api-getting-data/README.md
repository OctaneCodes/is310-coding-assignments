## PokeAPI
PokeAPI is one of the many of its kind. It is a database that you can call to find out information such as moves, abilities, types, egg groups, game versions, items, pokedexes, and evolution chains of pokemon. I started replaying Pokemon Heartgold that came out all the way back in 2009 recently and So my brain thought of the cultural phenomenon known as Pokemon. This playthrough of Heart Gold is just over 15 years after my first playthrough on a now long lost copy of the game. I have been a dedicated fan since then and own nearly every mainline pokemon game from GBA all the way to the current console of the Switch.  

Pokemon has had a profound cultural impact as this specific API turns 10 years old on December 4th of this year which is madly impressive.  

All I will say though, is that I hate pyeuropa api with a passion.
